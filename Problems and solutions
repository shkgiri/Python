2) How to see problems around with mathematical eyes and create Math model and then solve it with Python code. You will feel it 

I have a real data in g sheet. Now change that in to list in python, then create a function in python that tells me if i am financially prepared. 

Challenge:

Mitre ATT&CK is a very good repository. But the conditions under which that attack can be performed is not coded any where. If we can create a python code representation of att&ck, that will be really good. We can do similar to PYTM and generate conditions.
